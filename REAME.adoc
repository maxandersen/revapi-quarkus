= Revapi Quarkus Extension

This is an experimental Revapi extension for checking Quarkus extensions.

Currently, it only checks for changes in the `META-INF/quarkus-extension.yaml` files
but in the future it could also check for configuration changes by scanning the annotated
configuration classes, etc.
